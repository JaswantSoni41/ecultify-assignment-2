## Project Overview
Here it's my 2nd assiagnment which I completed Successfully. Here the poject was develop on ReactJS using a framework [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and styling with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and using  axios which is a a JavaScript library that allows developers to make HTTP requests to a server to fetch data, with customizable, and reusable React components for modern web development. And for Icons i use [React-Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/). Also for getting and converting the video output from gif here i use [@ffmpeg/core@0.10.0 and @ffmpeg/ffmpeg@0.10.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ffmpeg/ffmpeg/v/0.10.0). <br/>

Here I made this website very clean and maintains its responsiveness and also some of the custom components are there in the components folder namely ImageUpload.jsx and LoadingIndicator.jsx.
